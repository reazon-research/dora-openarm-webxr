"""WebXR server node for OpenArm teleoperation.

This dora-rs node serves the WebXR front-end over HTTPS and accepts a
WebSocket connection from a VR device such as Meta Quest 3 or PICO 4.
For each frame received from the device, it converts the controller
pose from WebXR coordinates into the OpenArm workspace, smooths it with
a One Euro filter, and publishes the pose, trigger, joystick and button
state as dora-rs outputs.

The published poses are expressed in the scene's ``arm_origin`` site
frame (chest-level origin between the arms), not in world coordinates.
Downstream IK interprets targets in the same frame. The hand position
is relative to the headset but keeps the world axes, so looking around
does not drag the target with the head.

The headset pose that the hands are made relative to is published as
is on ``pose_reference``, in the WebXR reference space, for consumers
that drive something from head motion such as a neck.

The Web server and the dora-rs event loop run concurrently in a single
asyncio event loop; the server shuts down when the dora-rs node
receives a ``STOP`` event.
