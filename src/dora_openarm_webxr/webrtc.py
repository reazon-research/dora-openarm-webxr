"""WebXR teleoperation over WebRTC.

Pose, session control and camera media ride one peer connection, so the page
can be served by anyone -- this node over HTTPS during development, or a
hosted service in production. WebRTC authenticates itself with a self-signed
certificate and an SDP fingerprint, so a node reached this way needs no
certificate of its own and no HTTPS server.

Two data channels, split by what they can afford to lose:

* ``xr`` -- opened by the browser, **unordered and never retransmitted**.
  Carries the ``frame`` messages at the WebXR animation frame rate
  (72-120 Hz on a Quest 3). Only the newest pose is worth anything, so a
  lost frame is dropped rather than retransmitted; the next one
  supersedes it. Frames carry a ``sequence`` so the receiver can drop the
  stale ones an unordered channel occasionally delivers late.
* ``control`` -- opened by this node, reliable and ordered. Carries the
  things that must not be lost: the node pushes the view configuration
  and the calibration flag once on open, the browser sends
  ``session-start``, and the node sends back what came of a calibration
  run. Pushing the configuration is what lets a page this node never
  served still know how to draw itself.

Camera frames leave on WebRTC video tracks. The control channel names each
track's role -- head eye, THETA panorama or wrist side -- because negotiation
order alone cannot tell the browser which panel should draw it. Every track on
a connection shares one RTP clock so related camera frames cannot drift onto
independent timelines.
